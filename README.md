# C/C++ for Visual Studio Code

This repository contains most of my C/C++ programs. The setup for C/C++ to Visual Studio Code, including features such as IntelliSense and debugging are included.

## Overview and getting started
* [C/C++ extension overview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp)

## Offline installation

The extension has platform-specific binary dependencies, therefore installation via the Marketplace requires an Internet connection in order to download additional dependencies. If you are working on a computer that does not have access to the Internet or is behind a strict firewall, you may need to use our platform-specific packages and install them by running VS Code's `"Install from VSIX..."` command. These "offline' packages are available at: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools/releases.

 Package | Platform
:--- | :---
`cpptools-linux.vsix` | Linux 64-bit
`cpptools-linux32.vsix` | Linux 32-bit
`cpptools-osx.vsix` | macOS
`cpptools-win32.vsix` | Windows 64-bit & 32-bit
